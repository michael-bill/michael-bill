### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Michael Biloshitskiy.
I am a student at ITMO University in St. Petersburg majoring in Software Engineering. At the same time, Iâ€™m trying to working as an Android developer, but Iâ€™m also interested in many other programming languages.

In my github you can find several useful and sometimes funny repositories. Enjoy watching. Have a nice day!
