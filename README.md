### Hi there 👋

My name is Michael Biloshitskiy.
I am a student at ITMO University in St. Petersburg majoring Software Engineering. 👨‍💻<br/>
At the same time, I’m trying to working as an Java Android developer, but I’m also interested in many other programming languages. 🧠<br/>
In my github you can find several useful and sometimes funny repositories. ✅<br/>
Enjoy watching. Fewer bugs for you, may the fast Internet always be with you and have a nice day! 🙌<br/>
